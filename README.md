# My Crypto Hoard

A straightforward crypto asset viewer, currently available for Solana connected wallets.

This project is my first foray into any kind of web3 development as well as my first time using TS. It's a basic web app that connect with your crypto wallet (currently only set up for the Solana blockchain) and shows all your NFTs.
